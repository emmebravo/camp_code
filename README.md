# Camp Code Repo

Following AB's Camp Code (https://class.mastermnd.io/base-camp/camp-code) for the next 22 weeks!

My main reason for being part of this cmap is because I want to eventually move to be a solely Backend Engineer, and Go is a great language and one in great demand.

You're welcome to follow, but as a whole is just me "learning in the open."

###### feeling proud I made this repository all from within my terminal, and currently editing this on Vim. I take pride in the smallest things lol
